**Rapid Engine**
PHP Micro Framework being used for a small social network project.  

Goals are:

 - As unobtrusive as possible, stay out of the developer's way and don't dictate program flow.  
 - As little 'boiler plate' code as possible inside the application.
 - All code, no XML or command line tools.
